## Login Page:

-   The login button will be disabled in the initial stage. Please provide your email and password otherwise you can't log in. After providing your email and password, click the "Next" button and proceed. You can proceed to the next step with the dummy email and password here.

## LoginCode Page:

-   This step will ask you to enter a 6-digit code. You have to enter this code within 10 seconds. If you fail to join within 10 seconds, the "Verify" button will be disabled. Since this is a dummy login, you can proceed to the next step by clicking on the “Verify” button without entering any code. But you have to remember that the click must be done within 10 seconds.

## Success Page:

-You can reach this page only if you have done the previous steps correctly.
